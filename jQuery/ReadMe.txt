//Terminate the process
Method 	Scope	Used with setTimeout?
clearTimeout()	Stops the timer	Yes, used to cancel the scheduled task.
return	Exits the current function	Yes, used inside the callback function.
break	Exits a loop/switch	Yes, if you have a loop inside the callback.
throw new Error()	Crashes/stops current flow	Yes, but requires a try/catch to be safe.
process.exit()	Kills the whole app (Node.js)	Yes, if you want the script to end entirely.




fetch() ==  for api call (Async)
Promise  -- Handles asynchronous results 
.then()  ---  when we get the response ( success)
.catch() --- Error handler

document.write or innerHTML  --- to display on browser /  used for dynamic updates instead of refreshing the whole page 

Optimization

Improving the performance by reducing unnecessary work 


deferred objects:

 when we are performing multiple async operation

 jQUery (uses this to handle async operations )(very much similar to Promise)

function async()
{
let deferred = $.Deferred();

setTimeout(()=>
let success = true;
   if(success)
   {

	deferred .resolve("Task completed")

   }
   else{
	deferred.reject("Task failed")
   }
   , 5000)
   };

   Optimization
   Indexing
   lazy loading
